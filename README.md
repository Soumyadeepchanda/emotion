# 🎭 Emotion Detection using CNN deep learning model.

This project focuses on detecting **human emotions** using deep learning.  
The model classifies emotions into **five categories**:

1. 😊 Happy  
2. 😢 Sad  
3. 😡 Angry  
4. 😱 Surprised  
5. 😐 Neutral

## 🧠 Model Overview

The model is built using **TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch** and includes:  
- Input layer  
- Hidden layers for feature extraction  
- Output layer with 5 neurons (Softmax activation)
